# GTK Array Operations

This project demonstrates basic array operations using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with GTK (GIMP Toolkit) in C.

## Features

1. **Insert Element**: Allows the user to insert a new element into the array at a specified position.

2. **Delete Element**: Enables the user to delete an element from the array based on the index.

3. **Search Element**: Allows the user to search for a specific element in the array.

4. **Display Array**: Displays the current elements in the array.

5. **Traverse Array**: Displays the elements of the array in reverse order.

6. **Merge Arrays**: Allows the user to merge the current array with a new array.

7. **Exit**: Exits the program.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the GTK development libraries installed on your system. If not, you can install them using:

- On Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu):
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
  ```

- On Red Hat-based systems (like Fedora):
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install gtk3-devel
  ```

### Compilation

Compile the program using the following command:

```bash
gcc -o gui gui.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0`
```

### Running the Program

Run the compiled program:

```bash
./gui
```

## Usage

1. Upon launching the application, a window with buttons for various array operations will appear.

2. Click on the buttons to perform the corresponding array operations.

3. Follow the on-screen prompts for input (e.g., element values, positions, array sizes).

4. The output label will display the results of the operations or any error messages.

5. Click the "Exit" button to close the application.
